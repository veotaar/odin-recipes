  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  
  <h4>Pizza Crust:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>¼ cup water</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons flaxseed meal</li>
    <li>5 cups cauliflower florets</li>
    <li>½ cup rolled oats</li>
    <li>1 teaspoons dried rosemary</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Vegan Mozzarella Cheese:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>¾ cup cashews</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tapioca starch</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon nutritional yeast</li>
    <li>1 teaspoons apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Marinara Sauce:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoons maple syrup</li>
    <li>1 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoons red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>



  <h4>Toppings:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>½ cup cherry tomatoes, sliced</li>
    <li>½ cup basil leaves</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Whisk 1/4 cup water and flaxseed meal together in a large bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until fall-apart tender, 3 to 6 minutes. Let cool, at least 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Grind oats, rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder together in a food processor until flourlike in texture.</li>
    <li>Place cooled cauliflower in a fine cheesecloth and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. Add pressed cauliflower to the bowl with the flaxseed-water mixture and stir well. Stir in the oat mixture. Form dough into a ball and place onto the lined baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Press dough ball down into a circle. Lay a sheet of parchment on top and roll dough flat using a rolling pin to about 1/4-inch thick.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is set, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven; leave oven on.</li>
    <li>Place cashews into a pot with water to cover; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until soft, about 15 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Puree boiled cashews, 1 1/4 cups fresh water, tapioca starch, nutritional yeast, cider vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder in a blender. Pour puree into a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring continuously, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, 1 teaspoon salt, red pepper flakes, oregano, and black pepper. Simmer marinara sauce until flavors blend, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Fill blender halfway with marinara sauce. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour into a bowl. Repeat with any remaining marinara sauce.</li>
    <li>Spread marinara sauce over the cauliflower crust; top with the 'mozzarella cheese' and add cherry tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Bake in the hot oven until sauce is bubbling and crust is golden brown, about 8 minutes. Top with basil.</li>

  </ol>
